Overview
--------

The **neutrino** is a prototype framework that provides custom cryptocurrency tracking views and executes \
data-driven orders via the Coinbase Pro platform. **It is currently under development.**

The first goal of this program is to provide actionable views that are not readily available \
on most of the major exchanges, such as:

   1. What is my total cost basis for X currency in USD, considering all historical trades on this account \
      (including crypto-to-crypto transactions)? What is my current gain/loss given the current market prices?  

   2. What is the gain/loss of X currency *from the perspective of Y point in time*? \
      Popular views show the 24-hour delta, but this moving window and can lead to counterintuitive reports. \
      For example, a currency may show an increasingly positive 24-hour delta despite a current decrease in price, \
      provided that there was a more servere drop 24 hours ago and a subsequent recovery in between.

   3. How are XYZ currencies performing in *relative to each other, from the perspective of Y point in time*?

These are relatively simple examples, but one can imagine the usefulness of this data as a starting point \
for constructing portfolio trackers and trading algorithms. At the risk of derailing this high-level overview, \
here's a simple prototype view that shows the performance of various currencies relative to BTC \
using a fixed frame of reference:

This kind of view gives a clear apples-to-apples comparison of performance across cryptocurrency by \
fixing the reference point to eliminate the moving window problem. In this case, it's particularly useful for traders \
who prefer BTC over fiat, but the chart can easily be switched to use any reference currency such as USD.

In any case, documentation of this program is by no means complete (some would say it has hardly begun) - \
but here are a few screenshots of the current command line interface as-is:

Development Approach
====================

Formation of the **neutrino** is taking place across three phrases. It is currently in **Phase 1**, as is evident by its current lack of unit tests and architectural documentation:

   Phase 1 - Initial development
      * Framework and tooling
      * Data pulling features
      * Prototype CLI
      * Unit tests and documentation
   
   Phase 2 - Reporting and analytics
      * Local database configuration
      * Analytics tooling
      * Reporting views and features
      * User manual

   Phase 3 - Data-driven actions
      * Data posting features
      * Trading algorithms and implementation
